The Notebook Web Application is designed to provide users with a platform to manage their notes efficiently. The application will feature user authentication functionalities, allowing users to sign up, log in, and log out securely. Additionally, users will be able to create, and delete their notes.

The project is mainly focusing on integrating a more adaptable, lightweight, and straightforward solution for note-taking with a minimalistic design. This approach caters to users looking for a quick and easy to use note-taking application without unnecessary complexities.

The Project's Story: why i worked on this project ?
I was working on a Music recommender project for the first two weeks of the project proposal , then I had to visit some family members in another city where I lost  my notebook where i was writing all the steps, languages , features, and requirements necessary for the project. 
At that time i had to restart everything from Zero!! So I decided to take notes on my laptop in order not to lose them again, then the idea comes to create my own note-taking application, i know that there are lots of similar applications but that will be a good lesson for me to never lose my notes.
